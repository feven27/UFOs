The purpose is to build tables using data stored in JavaScript, create filters to make tables, and bootstrap to customize the webpage we built with dana. Dana, a data journalist, as she takes the freedom to write an article about her hometown, McMinnville, Oregon which is also famous for its UFO sightings. In order to have readable data she has decided to use a Javascript data file she received to create a Webpage for her story and to make the data available to others. We will build a dynamic Webpage by inserting JavaScript into an HTML page. Weâ€™ll also be using Bootstrap to style the page for consistent functionality.
